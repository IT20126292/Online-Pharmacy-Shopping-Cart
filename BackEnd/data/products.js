Using infrared sensing, it is held before an individual at just above eye level and it is able to carefully evaluate the person’s current body temperature. If the temperature is normal, it is no cause for alarm and at the time the person is not seen as a risk and is allowed to pass through the entrance of the public area he wishes to enter. However, if that individual were to have a high temperature, the scanner would display the temperature and raise a small alarm indicating that he may be ill or carrying an infection.",
